        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p><strong>Abul Pakir Jainulabadeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) was an Indian
            aerospace scientist and statesman who served as
            11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
            physics and aerospace engineering. He
            spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and
            Indian Space Reasearch Organisation(ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
            and military missile development
            efforts. He thus came to known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of Ballistic
            Missile and luanch vehiacal technology.
            He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokharan-II nuclear tests
            in 1998, the first since the
            original nuclear test by India in 1974.
